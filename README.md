# XBase
Simple access to xBase data  (dBase III/IV, Foxpro etc) files in Perl 6

## Description

The main motivation behind this was "because I can", I've written
the same sort of thing in three or four other languages so it's
a no-brainer.  It might even prove useful to someone.

This should be able to deal with the datafiles of dBase III/IV
FoxPro, Clipper and the like, but may or may not support any later
versions based on the same version.
